# Orange_Titanic
Application of Orange Data Mining using Titanic dataset.

Orange is an open-source data visualization, machine learning, and data mining software suite. It offers a visual programming interface for data analysis and includes a variety of tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

In this example, I used traditional Titanic dataset from KAGGLE to perform data visualization and predictive modeling. Image below shows the overall workflow.

It takes less than 10min to develop the workflow, as this is quite common dataset for those who go through fundamental machine learning training in various instituition,with basic understanding about features and target of this dataset.

Data preprocessing and understanding the dataset.

Predictive modeling using 4 different machine learning algorithm include Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
