Application of Orange Data Mining using Titanic dataset.

Orange is an open-source data visualization, machine learning, and data mining software suite. It offers a visual programming interface for data analysis and includes a variety of tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

In this example, I used traditional Titanic dataset from KAGGLE to perform data visualization and predictive modeling. Image below shows the overall workflow.
